# Spam-Email-Dection
The objective of spam email detection is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam (also known as "ham"). The model should be able to identify patterns and features in the text of emails that are indicative of spam, and use these patterns to make predictions about whether a new email is likely to be spam or not. The model should be able to handle a variety of different types of spam, including unsolicited commercial messages, phishing scams, and other types of unwanted or malicious content. The performance of the model should be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Ultimately, the goal is to create a model that can help to reduce the amount of unwanted email that users receive, while minimizing the number of legitimate emails that are mistakenly classified as spam.
